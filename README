Input latching script.

Operation:

1) Select input devices to monitor
2) Start the monitoring. This will create a new virtual input to pass throught the ones you selected
3) Pick a latch button. When this button is held new presses will remain "stuck". Tap the latch button (without latching a key) to stop all latching. Tap a key that is latched to stop latching.
